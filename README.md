# 🇪🇨 Ecuador GADs: Financial Dependency Traffic Light
> **An ETL and Business Intelligence Project on Municipal Public Finance**

## 📌 Project Overview
Ecuador faces a severe liquidity crisis, highlighting a structural problem in its public administration: the extreme financial dependency of Decentralized Autonomous Governments (GADs) on the central government's equity model (Modelo de Equidad Territorial - MET).

This project is a **Data Engineering and Business Intelligence** exercise that transforms raw, unstructured budget execution datasets from the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) into an interactive, automated dependency map.

## 🎯 Objective
To build an automated ETL pipeline (using SQL) and a visual monitoring tool (Power BI) that flags municipalities where state transfers represent an unsustainable percentage (>80%) of their total budget, demonstrating a lack of autonomous revenue generation.
