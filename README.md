# 🇪🇨 [ON HOLD] Ecuador GADs: Financial Dependency & The 70/30 Rule
> **Status:** Project temporarily suspended due to lack of Open Data transparency.

## 📌 Project Overview
The objective of this Business Intelligence project was to build an automated dashboard tracking the financial execution of Ecuador's Decentralized Autonomous Governments (GADs). Specifically, it aimed to analyze the impact of the newly approved "70/30 Fiscal Rule" (which forces municipalities to allocate 70% of their budget to hard infrastructure and limits current expenditure to 30%).

The goal was to measure the "Social Gap": quantifying how many social programs (childcare, health, entrepreneurship) classified as "current expenditure" were at risk of being defunded or eliminated to comply with the law.

## 🛑 Why is this project on Stand-by?
As an analyst, data integrity and availability are non-negotiable. 

Following the approval of the law, the official Open Data portals from the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and the Central Bank of Ecuador (BCE) became completely unavailable, or the specific granular datasets regarding local government budget execution were removed. 

**Analytical Decision:** Instead of building a simulated ETL pipeline using mock data, this project is on hold. Building a robust data model requires understanding the actual variables, potential proxies, and structural schema provided by the official source. Without transparent data, accurate economic modeling is impossible. 

Once the Ecuadorian government restores transparency to its financial portals and the data becomes public again, this repository will be updated with the full SQL scripts and Power BI models.
